## 👨‍💻 About Me  

I am a third-year **BSc in Information Technology** undergraduate at the **University of Moratuwa**, based in Matara, Sri Lanka.

I focus on designing and building **scalable backend systems**, **well-structured APIs**, and **modern full-stack web applications**. I enjoy working on projects that emphasize clean architecture, maintainability, and real-world problem solving.

My academic and project experience includes backend development, microservice-based systems, database-driven applications, and cloud-ready solutions. I also have a growing interest in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, particularly in applied and research-oriented systems.
